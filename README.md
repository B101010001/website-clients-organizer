This project is a comprehensive tool designed to manage and organize client information effectively. It enables users to input client details such as name, website URL, contact person, email, and phone number, along with the type of request (e.g., new client, site request, feature request, issue report). Additionally, it provides functionalities to add client requests with specific needs, display the information in a structured table, and export the data to CSV for external use. The app also includes a visualization feature, offering a chart to overview client distribution or request types, enhancing the management and tracking process of client interactions and needs.
